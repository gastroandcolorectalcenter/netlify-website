## What is Laparoscopic Surgery, it's benefits and uses in different diseases

Laparoscopic surgery, also known as minimally invasive surgery (MIS), has revolutionized the field of gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) surgeries in Nepal. This approach uses small incisions, specialized instruments, and a camera (laparoscope) to perform procedures that traditionally required large open incisions.

## Common Laparoscopic Surgeries

### Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (Gallbladder removal)

This procedure involves removal of the gallbladder, typically for gallstones or gallbladder inflammation which is one of the most common laparoscopic procedures.

**Technical aspects**: This surgery is performed with 3-4 small incisions (5 mm to 10mm), and gallbladder removed through the umbilical port in the bag. Patient is admitted on the day of surgery, oral feeding starts about 4 to 5 hours after surgery and discharged on the next day in more than 95% of cases.

**Recovery**: Majority of patient start their job 7 days after surgery. However, it may vary depending on the pain threshold of the patient and categories of work on the job.

### Laparoscopic Appendectomy (Appendix removal)

This is an Emergency Surgery performed for acute appendicitis on the same day of presenting to the Hospital.

**Technical aspects**: This surgery is performed with 3 small incisions (5 mm to 10mm), and appendix removed through the umbilical port in the bag. Oral feeding starts about 4 to 5 hours after surgery. Most of the patients are discharged on the next day.

**Recovery**: Majority of patient start their job 7 days after surgery. However, it may vary depending on the pain threshold of the patient and categories of work on the job.

### Laparoscopic Hernia Surgery

There are different types of hernia like:

- Inguinal hernia
- Femoral hernia
- Obturator hernia
- Incisional hernia
- Umbilical hernia
- Epigastric hernia
- Spigelian Hernia, etc

**Technical aspects**: This surgery is performed with 3 to 4 small incisions (5 mm to 10 mm). Oral feeding starts about 4 to 5 hours after surgery. Most of the patients are discharged on the next day or the second day depending on the types of hernia.

**Recovery**: Majority of patient start their job 7 to 10 days after surgery depending on the type of hernia. However, it may vary depending on the pain threshold of the patient and categories of work on the job.

### Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgeries

This is performed mostly for colorectal cancer and sometimes for inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis and rectal prolapse.

**Technical aspects**: Your will be admitted at least one day before surgery. You will be prescribed purgative to clear bowel content (stool). This surgery is performed with 5 small incisions (5 mm to 12 mm), and resected bowel will mesentery and lymph nodes will be removed in the bag through about 4 to 5 cm small incision. Temporary stoma will be made in rectal surgery and sometime permanent stoma for lower rectal cancer. Oral liquid feeding starts in about 2 to 3 days after surgery. Most of the patients is discharge in 5 to 7 days after surgery in most of the cases. Doctor will discuss with you everything before surgery and clear all your queries.

**Recovery**: Majority of patient start their job in 2 to 4 weeks after surgery. However, it may vary depending on the pain threshold of the patient and categories of work on the job.

**Common Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgeries are**:

- Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy
- Laparoscopic left hemicolectomy
- Laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy
- Laparoscopic low anterior resection
- Laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection
- Total proctocolectomy with IPAA
- Laparoscopic rectopexy for Rectal prolapse

<div class="key-point">

**Important Point**: Oncologically, laparoscopic colorectal surgery has been proven to have equivalent cancer outcomes to open surgery with better short-term results and quality of life. This is particularly important for cancer patients in Nepal seeking modern treatment options.

### Laparoscopic Gastric Surgeries

This is performed mostly for Gastric (stomach) cancer and sometimes for gastric outlet obstruction due to either chronic peptic ulcer disease of advanced distal gastric cancer.

**Technical aspects**: Your will be admitted at least one day before surgery. This surgery is performed with 5 small incisions (5 mm to 12 mm), and resected bowel will omentum and lymph nodes will be removed in the bag through about 4 to 5 cm small incision. Oral liquid feeding starts in about 2 to 3 days after surgery. Most of the patients is discharge in 7 to 10 days after surgery in most of the cases. Doctor will discuss with you everything before surgery and clear all your queries.

**Recovery**: Majority of patient start their job in 2 to 4 weeks after surgery. However, it may vary depending on the pain threshold of the patient and categories of work on the job.

**Common Laparoscopic Gastric Surgeries are**:

- Laparoscopic D2 total gastrectomy
- Laparoscopic D2 subtotal gastrectomy
- Laparoscopic gastric wedge resection for gastric GIST
- Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy with or without vagotomy

## Laparoscopy in Emergency Settings

Increasingly used for diagnosis and treatment in acute abdominal conditions at major hospitals in Kathmandu and Lalitpur, including perforated ulcers, small bowel obstruction, and trauma.

## Benefits of Laparoscopic Surgery in Nepal

<div class="key-point">

### Key Statistics

- Over 15 million laparoscopic procedures are performed globally each year
- Reduced hospital stay by 50-70% compared to open procedures
- 90% lower risk of major incisional hernias
- Significantly decreased postoperative pain and recovery time

**Important Point**: Laparoscopic procedures offer significant advantages over traditional open surgery while maintaining equivalent clinical outcomes in most indications. These benefits are particularly important in the Nepali context, where faster recovery can mean quicker return to work and family responsibilities.

</div>

### There are many benefits of laparoscopic surgery

<div class="benefits-grid">

#### Smaller Incisions
Laparoscopic procedures require only tiny cuts (0.5-1.2cm) compared to traditional open surgery, resulting in less scarring for patients.

#### Reduced Pain
Patients in Nepal experience significantly less post-operative pain, allowing for faster recovery and reduced need for pain medication.

#### Shorter Hospital Stays
Most laparoscopic patients in Kathmandu hospitals can return home within 24-48 hours, compared to 5-7 days for open procedures.

#### Faster Recovery Time
Nepali patients typically resume normal activities within 1-2 weeks versus 4-6 weeks with traditional surgery.

#### Lower Infection Risk
The minimally invasive nature results in decreased wound infection rates, important in Kathmandu's healthcare environment.

#### Less Internal Scarring
Reduced adhesion formation benefits long-term health outcomes for Nepali patients.

#### Better Visualization
High-definition cameras provide surgeons with magnified views of anatomical structures.

#### Reduced Blood Loss
Minimal bleeding during procedures creates safer surgical experiences in Nepal's medical facilities.

#### Cosmetic Advantages
Nearly invisible scars are particularly valued by patients concerned about appearance.

#### Access to World-Class Techniques
Modern laparoscopic procedures available in Nepal match international standards of care.

#### Cost-Effective Long-Term
While initial costs may be higher, Kathmandu patients save on shorter hospital stays and faster return to work.

## What are limitations of Laparoscopic Surgery?

### Absolute Contraindications

- Inability to tolerate general anesthesia
- Inability to tolerate pneumoperitoneum (e.g., severe cardiopulmonary disease)
- Uncorrected coagulopathy
- Diffuse peritonitis with hemodynamic instability
- Extensive adhesions from multiple previous abdominal surgeries (relative)

### Relative Contraindications

- Portal hypertension
- Severe heart or lung disease
- Morbid obesity (though laparoscopy may be preferred in these patients)
- Late-term pregnancy
- Previous extensive abdominal surgery

## Patient Selection and Preoperative Evaluation in Nepal

Careful patient selection is crucial for successful laparoscopic GI and HPB procedures:

- Complete medical history and physical examination
- Appropriate imaging studies (ultrasound, CT, MRI, etc.)
- Laboratory studies including liver function tests for HPB procedures
- Assessment of cardiopulmonary reserve
- Nutritional status evaluation, particularly for major resections
- Previous surgical history and potential adhesions
- Body habitus considerations
- Distance from hospital for post-discharge follow-up (important for patients from remote areas)

<div class="key-point">

**Important Point**: The decision between open and laparoscopic approaches should be individualized based on patient factors, surgeon experience, and institutional capabilities. Conversion to open surgery should not be considered a complication but a prudent decision when necessary for patient safety.

</div>

<div class="key-point">

**Important Point**: Patients should receive thorough preoperative counseling about the laparoscopic approach, including the possibility of conversion to open surgery and potential complications.
