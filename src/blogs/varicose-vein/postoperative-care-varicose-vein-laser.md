Laser treatment for varicose veins, also known as Endovenous Laser Treatment (EVLT) or Endovenous Laser Ablation (EVLA), offers a minimally invasive solution with excellent results. However, proper postoperative care is crucial for optimal healing and long-term success. This comprehensive guide will walk you through every aspect of your recovery journey.

## Understanding Your Procedure

Before diving into postoperative care, it's important to understand what happened during your laser treatment. The procedure involved:

1. Local anesthesia administration
2. Small catheter insertion into the affected vein
3. Laser fiber delivery of controlled heat energy
4. Vein wall collapse and sealing
5. Natural blood rerouting through healthier veins

The treated vein will gradually be absorbed by your body over the coming weeks and months.

## Immediate Post-Procedure Care (First 24 Hours)

### Right After the Procedure

**What to Expect:**
- You'll be awake and alert
- Mild discomfort at the treatment site
- Compression stockings already in place
- Ability to walk immediately

**Immediate Instructions:**

**Walking is Essential**
- Walk for 10-15 minutes before leaving the clinic
- Continue walking throughout the day
- Aim for short walks every hour while awake
- Avoid sitting or standing still for long periods

भेरिकोज भेनको लेजर उपचारलाई **Endovenous Laser Treatment (EVLT)** वा **Endovenous Laser Ablation (EVLA)** भनिन्छ।\
यो **सानो चिरा गरेर गरिने सुरक्षित र प्रभावकारी उपचार** हो।\
तर उपचार सफल हुन **शल्यक्रिया पछिको हेरचाह (post-operative care)** अत्यन्त महत्त्वपूर्ण हुन्छ।

यस गाइडले तपाईंलाई **शल्यक्रिया पछि दिन--दिनमा के गर्ने, के अपेक्षा गर्ने, र दीर्घकालीन रूपमा कसरी राम्रो नतिजा राख्ने** भन्ने कुरा बुझाउँछ।

* * * * *

तपाईंको उपचार के हो भन्ने कुरा बुझौँ
------------------------------------

लेजर उपचार गर्दा तपाईंको खुट्टाको खराब भेनमा के गरिएको थियो?

-   लोकल एनेस्थेसिया (सुन्याउने औषधि) दिइयो

-   सानो नली (क्याथेटर) भेनभित्र राखियो

-   लेजर फाइबरबाट ताप ऊर्जा दिइयो

-   खराब भेन बन्द गरियो

-   रगत अब स्वस्थ भेनहरूबाट बग्न थाल्छ

बन्द गरिएको भेन **केही हप्ता देखि महिनासम्ममा शरीरले आफैं बिस्तारै सोस्छ**।
