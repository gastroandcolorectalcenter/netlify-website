Laser treatment for varicose veins, also known as Endovenous Laser Treatment (EVLT) or Endovenous Laser Ablation (EVLA), offers a minimally invasive solution with excellent results. However, proper postoperative care is crucial for optimal healing and long-term success. This comprehensive guide will walk you through every aspect of your recovery journey.

*Properly fitted compression stockings are essential for recovery*

## Understanding Your Procedure

Before diving into postoperative care, it's important to understand what happened during your laser treatment. The procedure involved:

1. Local anesthesia administration
2. Small catheter insertion into the affected vein
3. Laser fiber delivery of controlled heat energy
4. Vein wall collapse and sealing
5. Natural blood rerouting through healthier veins

The treated vein will gradually be absorbed by your body over the coming weeks and months.

## Immediate Post-Procedure Care (First 24 Hours)

### Right After the Procedure

**What to Expect:**
- You'll be awake and alert
- Mild discomfort at the treatment site
- Compression stockings already in place

**Immediate Instructions:**

**Walking is Essential**
- Walk for 10-15 minutes before leaving the clinic
- Continue walking throughout the day
- Aim for short walks every hour while awake
