You're not alone. Hemorrhoids (also called piles) affect millions worldwide, yet many people suffer in silence due to embarrassment. Understanding this common condition helps you recognize symptoms early, get proper diagnosis, and take steps to prevent complications.

This comprehensive, patient-friendly guide explains everything about hemorrhoids in simple terms, helping you make informed decisions about your health.

## What Are Hemorrhoids?

Hemorrhoids, also known as piles, are **swollen veins in the lower rectum and anus**. They may cause discomfort, bleeding, and itching. Understanding hemorrhoids helps you manage symptoms and seek timely treatment.

<div class="flash-card" style="background: #e3f2fd; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3; margin: 20px 0;">

**💡 Simple Explanation**

Hemorrhoids = Swollen blood vessels in your rectum and anus that cause discomfort, bleeding, or pain. They're not dangerous in most cases, but they can significantly affect your quality of life.

</div>

## Types of Hemorrhoids

**Internal Hemorrhoids** sit inside your rectum where you can't see or feel them. Because this area has fewer pain nerves, internal hemorrhoids usually don't hurt. You might only notice them if:

-   They bleed during bathroom visits (bright red blood)
-   They push outside during straining (prolapse)
-   You feel fullness or incomplete evacuation

**External Hemorrhoids** form under the skin around your anus. These are more painful because the anal skin has many sensitive nerves. You can often feel external hemorrhoids as:

-   Bumps or lumps around the anus
-   Painful swelling when sitting
-   Tender areas that itch or irritate

**Thrombosed Hemorrhoids** happen when blood clots form inside an external hemorrhoid, creating a firm, very painful lump. These develop suddenly and need immediate attention because of severe pain.

## Recognizing Hemorrhoid Symptoms: What to Look For

- **Protrusion:** Internal hemorrhoids may protrude outside during bowel movements.  
- **Rectal Bleeding:** Bright red blood after passing stool.  
- **Itching/Irritation:** Common around the anal area.  
- **Discomfort/Pain:** External hemorrhoids may be painful, especially if thrombosed.  

---

Knowing what to watch for helps you seek help early and avoid complications. Symptoms vary depending on the type.

### Internal Hemorrhoid Warning Signs

**Painless Bleeding** is the hallmark sign. Look for:

-   Bright red blood on toilet paper after wiping
-   Red blood in the toilet bowl (appears separate from stool)
-   Blood streaks on stool surface
-   Small amounts of bleeding during or after bowel movements

**Other Internal Hemorrhoid Symptoms:**

-   Feeling that you haven't completely emptied your bowels
-   Mucus discharge causing wetness or irritation
-   Itching or discomfort in the anal area
-   A soft lump that pushes out during straining (prolapsed hemorrhoid)
-   Feeling of pressure or fullness in the rectum

<div class="flash-card" style="background: #fff3e0; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800; margin: 20px 0;">

**⚠️ Important to Know**

Internal hemorrhoids typically don't cause pain UNLESS they prolapse (push outside) and become trapped. If you experience sudden severe pain with a prolapsed hemorrhoid, seek medical attention promptly.

</div>

### External Hemorrhoid Warning Signs

External hemorrhoids are more likely to cause pain and discomfort. Watch for:

**Pain and Discomfort:**

-   Sharp or aching pain when sitting, especially on hard surfaces
-   Pain during bowel movements
-   Constant discomfort that worsens with activity
-   Difficulty finding comfortable sitting positions

**Visible and Palpable Changes:**

-   A sensitive lump or swelling near your anus
-   Hard bump you can feel when cleaning after bathroom use
-   Swelling that increases throughout the day
-   Bluish or purple discoloration if thrombosed

**Other Symptoms:**

-   Itching or irritation around the anal area
-   Bleeding when you wipe or pass stool
-   Difficulty cleaning the area properly after bathroom use
-   Moisture or mucus discharge

### Thrombosed Hemorrhoid Emergency Signs

These develop suddenly and cause intense symptoms:

**Severe Pain:**

-   Sudden onset of intense pain (often wakes you from sleep)
-   Constant pain that doesn't improve with position changes
-   Sharp, throbbing pain that limits movement
-   Pain that makes sitting nearly impossible

**Visible Changes:**

-   A hard, bluish or purple lump near the anus (size of a grape or larger)
-   Significant swelling in the anal area
-   Firm mass that's very tender to touch
-   Possible skin breakdown or ulceration over the lump

<div class="flash-card" style="background: #fce4ec; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #e91e63; margin: 20px 0;">

**🚨 When to Seek Immediate Care**

Go to the emergency room or call your doctor immediately if you experience:

-   Heavy rectal bleeding that won't stop
-   Severe pain not relieved by over-the-counter medications
-   Dizziness or lightheadedness with bleeding
-   Large amounts of blood (more than a few tablespoons)
-   Dark, tarry stools (indicates bleeding higher in digestive tract)
-   Fever along with rectal pain or bleeding

</div>

### Don't Ignore These Symptoms

**Remember:** Rectal bleeding can indicate serious conditions beyond hemorrhoids, including:

-   Colorectal cancer
-   Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis)
-   Anal fissures (tears in anal lining)
-   Polyps or growths
-   Diverticular disease

**Always consult a doctor if you experience:**

-   Rectal bleeding for the first time
-   Bleeding that persists for more than a week
-   Changes in bowel habits lasting over two weeks
-   You're over 50 with new bleeding (higher cancer risk)
-   Family history of colorectal cancer
-   Unexplained weight loss with bowel symptoms

## What Causes Hemorrhoids? Understanding Your Risk

Understanding causes helps you prevent hemorrhoids. The main culprit is increased pressure on the veins in your pelvic and anal area.

### Primary Pressure-Related Causes

**Straining During Bowel Movements** is the #1 cause. When you're constipated and push hard to pass stool, you put tremendous pressure on rectal veins. Over time, this:

-   Weakens vein walls
-   Causes blood vessels to swell
-   Stretches supporting tissues
-   Creates permanent damage

**Sitting Too Long on the Toilet** restricts blood flow and increases pressure. Many people:

-   Sit and read or use phones (prolonging bathroom time)
-   Push repeatedly trying to "finish"
-   Relax pelvic floor muscles too long
-   Cut off circulation to the area

<div class="flash-card" style="background: #e8f5e9; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; margin: 20px 0;">

**✅ Bathroom Rule of Thumb**

Your bathroom visit should take 5 minutes or less. If you're sitting longer, you're putting unnecessary pressure on hemorrhoidal veins. Don't bring your phone to the toilet!

</div>

**Chronic Constipation** creates a vicious cycle:

-   Hard stools require straining
-   Straining damages veins
-   Hemorrhoids make bowel movements uncomfortable
-   Fear of pain causes further constipation
-   Cycle continues and worsens

**Chronic Diarrhea** causes problems too:

-   Frequent bowel movements irritate tissues
-   Acidic stool damages delicate skin
-   Repeated wiping causes inflammation
-   Weakens anal sphincter muscles

### Pregnancy and Hemorrhoids

**Pregnancy is a major risk factor.** Here's why:

**Increased Pressure:**

-   Growing baby presses on pelvic veins
-   Uterus compresses inferior vena cava (major vein)
-   Blood flow from lower body restricted
-   Veins in pelvis become engorged

**Hormonal Changes:**

-   Progesterone relaxes vein walls
-   Blood vessels become more expandable
-   Constipation worsens (hormones slow digestion)
-   Tissues soften and stretch easier

**During Labor:**

-   Intense pushing during delivery
-   Enormous pressure on pelvic floor
-   Many women develop hemorrhoids during childbirth
-   Usually improve after delivery (but may persist)

**Pregnancy Hemorrhoid Facts:**

-   Up to 50% of pregnant women develop hemorrhoids
-   Most common in third trimester
-   May worsen with each pregnancy
-   Usually improve 6-8 weeks after delivery

### Weight and Lifestyle Factors

**Being Overweight or Obese:**

-   Increases abdominal pressure constantly
-   Extra weight compresses pelvic veins
-   More strain during bowel movements
-   Higher risk of developing hemorrhoids
-   Slows recovery if hemorrhoids develop

**Low-Fiber Diet:**

-   Causes hard, difficult-to-pass stools
-   Leads to constipation and straining
-   Increases time spent on toilet
-   Most common dietary cause

**Not Drinking Enough Water:**

-   Makes constipation worse
-   Stools become harder
-   Body absorbs more water from stool
-   Increases need to strain

**Lack of Physical Activity:**

-   Weakens digestive system
-   Slows bowel movements
-   Reduces circulation
-   Contributes to constipation
-   Increases sitting time

**Heavy Lifting with Poor Technique:**

-   Increases abdominal pressure dramatically
-   Similar strain as difficult bowel movement
-   Holding breath while lifting makes it worse
-   Repeated heavy lifting damages veins

### Age and Hereditary Factors

**Getting Older Increases Risk:**

-   Supporting tissues weaken with age
-   Veins lose elasticity naturally
-   Muscles supporting rectum weaken
-   More common after age 50
-   Lifetime cumulative pressure takes toll

**Family History Matters:**

-   If parents/siblings had hemorrhoids, your risk increases
-   May inherit weak connective tissue
-   Genetic predisposition to weak vein walls
-   Similar bowel patterns often run in families

### Other Contributing Factors

**Chronic Coughing:**

-   From smoking, asthma, allergies, or respiratory conditions
-   Each cough increases abdominal pressure
-   Repetitive strain on pelvic veins
-   COPD patients at higher risk

**Liver Disease:**

-   Causes portal hypertension (increased pressure in liver veins)
-   Backs up blood flow to rectal veins
-   Cirrhosis patients commonly develop hemorrhoids

**Inflammatory Bowel Disease:**

-   Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis
-   Chronic inflammation weakens tissues
-   Frequent diarrhea damages area
-   Increased straining during flares

**Anal Intercourse:**

-   Can irritate and damage anal tissues
-   May contribute to hemorrhoid development
-   Weakens sphincter muscles over time

**Prolonged Sitting:**

-   Office workers at higher risk
-   Truck drivers, pilots frequently affected
-   Sitting cuts circulation to area
-   Increases pressure on pelvic veins

## How Are Hemorrhoids Diagnosed? What to Expect

Getting proper diagnosis is crucial because other conditions can mimic hemorrhoid symptoms. Here's what happens during evaluation.

### Your Medical History: Be Prepared to Discuss

Your doctor will ask detailed questions. Prepare to discuss:

**Symptom Details:**

-   When symptoms started and how long they've lasted
-   Type of symptoms (bleeding, pain, itching, lumps)
-   Timing (constant, only during bowel movements, after sitting)
-   Severity (mild annoyance vs. severe pain)
-   What makes symptoms better or worse

**Bowel Habits:**

-   Frequency of bowel movements
-   Stool consistency (hard, normal, loose)
-   Straining during bowel movements
-   Time spent on toilet
-   Recent changes in habits

**Diet and Lifestyle:**

-   Fiber intake from fruits, vegetables, whole grains
-   Daily water consumption
-   Physical activity level
-   Occupational factors (sitting jobs, heavy lifting)

**Medical and Family History:**

-   Previous hemorrhoids or treatments
-   Family history of digestive problems
-   Colorectal cancer in family
-   Chronic conditions (diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease)
-   Current medications

<div class="flash-card" style="background: #e3f2fd; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3; margin: 20px 0;">

**💡 Tip: Be Honest**

Don't feel embarrassed! Doctors examine hemorrhoids daily. Providing accurate information helps ensure correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Your honesty could prevent serious complications from being missed.

</div>

### Physical Examination

**Visual Inspection:**

-   Doctor examines external anal area
-   Looks for external hemorrhoids, skin tags, fissures
-   Checks for swelling, redness, or abnormalities
-   Assesses skin condition and hygiene

**Digital Rectal Examination (DRE):**

-   Doctor inserts gloved, lubricated finger into rectum
-   Feels for abnormalities, masses, or internal hemorrhoids
-   Assesses sphincter muscle tone
-   Checks prostate (in men)
-   Usually causes minimal discomfort

**What to Expect:**

-   Typically done lying on left side with knees bent
-   Takes only a few minutes
-   May feel pressure but shouldn't be painful
-   Critical for ruling out serious conditions

### Diagnostic Procedures

**Anoscopy (Most Common for Hemorrhoids):**

-   Small, tubular instrument (anoscope) inserted 2-3 inches into rectum
-   Allows direct visualization of internal hemorrhoids
-   Examines anal canal and lower rectum lining
-   Takes just a few minutes
-   Minimal discomfort
-   Done in office without anesthesia

**Proctoscopy:**

-   Similar to anoscopy but longer scope
-   Visualizes more of rectum
-   Used if anoscopy findings unclear
-   Helps assess extent of hemorrhoids
-   Quick outpatient procedure

**Sigmoidoscopy (Flexible):**

-   Thin, flexible tube with camera
-   Examines lower portion of colon and rectum
-   Recommended if you have:
    -   Changes in bowel habits
    -   Family history of colon cancer
    -   Are over 50 with new bleeding
    -   Symptoms suggesting other conditions

**When Sigmoidoscopy Is Needed:**

-   First-time rectal bleeding over age 50
-   Unexplained changes in bowel habits
-   Weight loss with digestive symptoms
-   Family history of colorectal cancer
-   Symptoms not typical for hemorrhoids

**Colonoscopy (Full Colon Exam):**

-   Examines entire colon with camera scope
-   Recommended screening at age 45-50
-   Essential if concerning symptoms present
-   Can detect polyps, cancer, inflammation
-   Usually requires bowel preparation

**Who Needs Colonoscopy:**

-   Age 45+ for routine screening
-   Family history of colorectal cancer
-   Unexplained anemia
-   Persistent bleeding
-   Significant changes in bowel patterns
-   High-risk factors present

### Laboratory Tests

**Blood Tests May Include:**

**Complete Blood Count (CBC):**

-   Checks for anemia from chronic bleeding
-   Evaluates overall health status
-   Looks for signs of infection

**Stool Tests:**

-   Fecal occult blood test (checks for hidden blood)
-   Stool culture if infection suspected
-   Calprotectin (if inflammatory bowel disease suspected)

### Hemorrhoid Grading System

Doctors classify internal hemorrhoids by grade:

**Grade 1:**

-   Small swelling inside rectum
-   Don't prolapse (push out)
-   May bleed but no pain
-   Not visible externally

**Grade 2:**

-   Prolapse during straining
-   Return inside automatically
-   May bleed more than Grade 1
-   Mild to moderate symptoms

**Grade 3:**

-   Prolapse during bowel movements
-   Need to manually push back inside
-   More symptoms and discomfort
-   May require treatment

**Grade 4:**

-   Permanently prolapsed (stay outside)
-   Cannot be pushed back inside
-   Significant symptoms
-   Usually require treatment

**External Hemorrhoids:**

-   Not graded same way
-   Classified by symptoms and thrombosis
-   Assessed individually

<div data-lang="ne">

तपाईं एक्लै हुनुहुन्न। **बवासीर (पाइल्स)** संसारभर लाखौं मानिसलाई हुने सामान्य समस्या हो। लाज वा संकोचका कारण धेरैजसो मानिस चुपचाप पीडा सहिरहेका हुन्छन्।\
यस रोगबारे सही जानकारी भएमा लक्षण चाँडै चिनिन्छ, सही उपचार पाइन्छ र जटिलता हुनबाट बच्न सकिन्छ।

यो **बिरामी-मैत्री मार्गदर्शिका** ले बवासीर के हो, किन हुन्छ, लक्षण, जाँच, उपचार र रोकथाम सबै कुरा सरल भाषामा बुझाउँछ।

## बवासीर (Hemorrhoids) भनेको के हो?

**बवासीर भनेको मलद्वार (गुदा) र मलाशयको भित्री भागमा भएका रगतका नसा फुल्नु (सुन्निनु)** हो।\
यसले दुखाइ, रगत बग्ने, चिलाउने जस्ता समस्या ल्याउन सक्छ।

<div class="flash-card" style="background:#e3f2fd;padding:20px;border-left:4px solid #2196f3;margin:20px 0;">

### 💡 सरल बुझाइ

**बवासीर = गुदा र मलाशयका नसाहरू फुलेर दुख्ने, रगत आउने वा असहज हुने अवस्था।**\
धेरैजसो अवस्थामा खतरनाक हुँदैन, तर जीवनस्तरमा ठूलो असर पार्न सक्छ।

</div>

## बवासीरका प्रकार

### १) भित्री बवासीर (Internal Hemorrhoids)

भित्री बवासीर **मलाशय भित्र** हुन्छ, त्यसैले बाहिरबाट देखिँदैन वा छुँदा महसुस हुँदैन।\
यहाँ दुख्ने नसाहरू कम हुने भएकाले सामान्यतया दुख्दैन।

**यसका लक्षणहरू:**

-   दिसा गर्दा चम्किलो रातो रगत आउनु

-   जोड लगाउँदा मासु बाहिर निस्किनु (prolapse)

-   दिसा गरेपछि पनि पूरा सफा नभएको जस्तो महसुस हुनु

### २) बाहिरी बवासीर (External Hemorrhoids)

बाहिरी बवासीर **गुदाको छालामुनि** हुन्छ। यहाँ नसाहरू धेरै संवेदनशील हुने भएकाले धेरै दुख्छ।

**लक्षणहरू:**

-   गुदा वरिपरि डल्लो वा गाँठो महसुस हुनु

-   बस्दा दुख्नु

-   चिलाउनु वा पोल्नु

### ३) रगत जमेको बवासीर (Thrombosed Hemorrhoids)

बाहिरी बवासीरभित्र रगत जमेर **एकदमै कडा र अत्यन्त दुख्ने डल्लो** बन्नु।

-   अचानक सुरु हुन्छ

-   असह्य दुखाइ हुन्छ

-   तुरुन्त चिकित्सक देखाउनुपर्छ

<img src="/assets/images/blog/hemorrhoids.webp" alt="भित्री र बाहिरी बवासीर" width="400" />

<figcaption>

## बवासीरका लक्षणहरू: के-के देखिन सक्छ?

-   **मासु बाहिर निस्किनु**

-   **दिसापछि रगत आउनु** (चम्किलो रातो)

-   **चिलाउने / जलन**

-   **दुखाइ वा असहजता** (बाहिरी बवासीरमा बढी)

## भित्री बवासीरका चेतावनी संकेत

### 🔴 दुखाइ बिना रगत आउनु (मुख्य लक्षण)

-   टिस्युमा रगत देखिनु

-   प्यानमा रगत टप्किनु

-   दिसामाथि रगतको धर्को देखिनु
