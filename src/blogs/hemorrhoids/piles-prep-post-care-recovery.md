<!-- English content (default) -->
Hemorrhoids (also known as piles) are a very common problem in Nepal. Swelling near anal area, bleeding during passing stool, itching near anal area, and discomfort while sitting can seriously affect daily activity. Laser treatment for hemorrhoids is a modern, minimally invasive procedure that allows faster recovery, less pain, and early return to work and normal life.

This articles will explain about laser treatment for hemorrhoids, pre-surgery preparation, expectation after laser treatment, activity guideline, and preventive measures to re-occur hemorrhoids 

## What Is Laser Treatment for Hemorrhoids?

Laser treatment for hemorrhoids is a modern, minimally invasive approach to treat hemorrhoids. The procedure typically takes 30-40 minutes and can be performed on an outpatient basis, meaning you can return home the same day.

Unlike traditional open surgical methods, laser treatment uses focused light guided diode laser directly into the hemorrhoids (dilated veins) to shrink hemorrhoid tissue with precision and less damage to normal tissue. Compared to traditional open surgery, this advanced technique (laser treatment) offers significant advantages including no large cuts, less pain, faster recovery, early return to work, and less bleeding.

## Assessment of Patient Before Surgery

**Before surgery, your doctor will:**
- Take detailed medical history
- Examine the anal area
- Check grade and type of hemorrhoids
- Review medications (BP, diabetes, blood thinners)
- Order basic blood tests, chest X-ray, ECG if needed

**⚠️ Always tell your doctor if you:**
- Have heart, lung, or kidney problems
- Are pregnant
- Are taking aspirin or blood thinners

**Things To Do Before Surgery**
- Do not eat or drink for 6–8 hours before surgery
- Take only medicines advised by your doctor

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<div class="faq-list">
  <details class="faq-item">
    <summary>How long does it take to fully recover from laser hemorrhoid treatment?</summary>
    <p>Most patients experience significant improvement within 1-2 weeks and achieve full recovery within 4-6 weeks. However, individual healing times vary based on the severity of hemorrhoids treated, overall health, and adherence to post-operative care instructions. Most people can return to work within 7 days and resume normal activities gradually over 3-4 weeks.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="faq-item">
    <summary>Is laser hemorrhoid treatment painful?</summary>
    <p>The procedure itself is performed under anesthesia, so you won't feel pain during treatment. After the procedure, you can expect mild to moderate discomfort for the first few days, which is significantly less than traditional surgery. Pain typically peaks on days 2-3 and gradually decreases. Your doctor will prescribe pain medications to manage discomfort effectively.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="faq-item">
    <summary>Can I go to work the next day after laser hemorrhoid treatment?</summary>
    <p>It depends on your job type. For desk jobs with minimal physical activity, many patients return to work within 5-7 days. However, if your job involves heavy lifting, prolonged standing, or physical labor, you may need 2-4 weeks off. It's best to rest for at least the first 2-3 days and consult with your doctor about when it's safe to return to your specific work duties.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="faq-item">
    <summary>What should I eat after laser hemorrhoid treatment?</summary>
    <p>Focus on a high-fiber diet including fruits (papaya, bananas, apples), vegetables (spinach, carrots), whole grains (oats, brown rice), and well-cooked lentils. Drink 8-10 glasses (2.5 to 3 lit) of water daily. Avoid spicy foods, fried foods, mean (specially red meat), alcohol, and processed foods. Soft, easily digestible foods help prevent constipation and reduce strain during bowel movements, promoting faster healing.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="faq-item">
    <summary>Is bleeding normal after laser hemorrhoid treatment?</summary>
    <p>Light bleeding or spotting during the first few days, especially with bowel movements, is normal. However, heavy bleeding that soaks through pads, doesn't stop, or occurs beyond the first week is not normal and requires immediate medical attention. Contact your doctor if you experience excessive bleeding or if bleeding increases rather than decreases over time.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="faq-item">
    <summary>When can I exercise after laser hemorrhoid treatment?</summary>
    <p>Start with gentle walking from day 1, which is encouraged. After 3 weeks, you can begin light stretching and yoga. Resume regular exercise and gym activities after 8-12 weeks with your doctor's approval. Avoid heavy lifting (over 5 kg) for at least 3 weeks. Activities like cycling, running, and intense workouts should wait until you're fully healed and cleared by your doctor.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="faq-item">
    <summary>Will hemorrhoids come back after laser treatment?</summary>
    <p>Recurrence is possible, but the risk is lower when you follow a high-fiber diet, stay well hydrated, avoid straining, and keep up with healthy bowel habits. Your surgeon can give personalized guidance based on your hemorrhoid grade and lifestyle factors.</p>
  </details>
  <details class="faq-item">
    <summary>How do I prevent constipation after the procedure?</summary>
    <p>Prevent constipation by drinking plenty of water (8-10 glasses daily), eating high-fiber foods, taking prescribed stool softeners, avoiding straining, and responding promptly to the urge to defecate. Regular gentle walking also helps stimulate bowel function. Your doctor may recommend fiber supplements if dietary fiber isn't sufficient.</p>

<div data-lang="ne">

नेपालमा बवासीर (पाइल्स) धेरै सामान्य समस्या हो। गुदा वरिपरि सुन्निनु, दिसा गर्दा रगत आउनु, चिलाउनु, र बस्दा असहजता हुनु दैनिक जीवनमा ठूलो असर पार्न सक्छ। बवासीरको लेजर उपचार आधुनिक, कम आघात (minimally invasive) विधि हो जसले कम दुखाइ, छिटो निको हुने, र छिट्टै काममा फर्कन मद्दत गर्छ।

यो लेखमा लेजर उपचार भनेको के हो, शल्यक्रिया अघि तयारी, शल्यक्रियापछि के-के अपेक्षा गर्ने, गतिविधि मार्गदर्शन, र दीर्घकालीन रोकथामका उपायहरू बुझाइन्छ।

## बवासीरको लेजर उपचार भनेको के हो?

लेजर उपचार बवासीर उपचार गर्ने आधुनिक र न्यून आक्रामक विधि हो। सामान्यतया 30–40 मिनेट लाग्छ र प्रायः outpatient आधारमा (त्यसै दिन घर जान मिल्ने) गरिन्छ।

परम्परागत ओपन सर्जरीको तुलनामा, लेजरमा dilated vein (बवासीरको सुन्निएको नस) भित्र सटीक रूपमा लेजर ऊर्जा पुर्‍याइन्छ। यसले वरपरको सामान्य टिस्युमा कम क्षति पुर्‍याउँछ। ठूलो चिरफार नहुने, कम दुखाइ, छिटो रिकभरी, छिट्टै काममा फर्कन सकिने, र कम रगत बग्ने जस्ता फाइदा हुन्छन्।
