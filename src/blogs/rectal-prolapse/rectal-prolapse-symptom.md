---

Rectal prolapse is a medical condition that many people feel embarrassed to discuss, yet it affects thousands of people in Nepal and worldwide. Understanding this condition is the first step toward getting proper treatment and improving your quality of life. This comprehensive guide will help you recognize the symptoms, understand the causes, and know when to seek medical help.

## What Is Rectal Prolapse?

Rectal prolapse is a condition in which the rectum (the last portion of the large intestine) loses its normal attachments inside the body, allowing it to telescope or protrude through the anus. In simple terms, part or all of the rectal wall slides out of place and can extend outside the body.

<div class="flash-card" style="background: #e8f5e9; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; margin: 20px 0;">

**💡 Understanding the Anatomy**

The rectum is the final 15-20 cm of your large intestine, located just above the anus. Normally, it's held in place by muscles, ligaments, and other supportive tissues of the pelvic floor. When these supports weaken, prolapse can occur.

</div>

### Types of Rectal Prolapse

**1. Complete Prolapse (Full-Thickness Prolapse)**
- The entire wall of the rectum protrudes through the anus
- Most common type
- Visible tissue extends outside the body
- Also called "external prolapse" or "true prolapse"

**2. Partial Prolapse (Mucosal Prolapse)**
- Only the inner lining (mucosa) of the rectum protrudes
- Less severe than complete prolapse
- May occur during bowel movements

**3. Internal Prolapse (Internal Intussusception)**
- The rectum collapses but doesn't protrude outside
- Not visible externally
- Can cause similar symptoms
- May progress to complete prolapse if untreated

## Who Gets Rectal Prolapse?

### Common Demographics

**Women Over 50:**
- 6 times more common in women than men
- Often related to childbirth and weakened pelvic floor
- Hormonal changes after menopause may contribute

**Elderly Patients:**
- Most common in people over 60
- Age-related weakening of muscles and ligaments
- Multiple risk factors accumulate over time

**Children (Rare):**
- Usually occurs before age 4
- Often resolves with conservative treatment
- Different from adult prolapse

### Risk Factors

Understanding what increases your risk can help with prevention and early detection:

**Chronic Straining:**
- Chronic constipation
- Prolonged straining during bowel movements
- Frequent diarrhea
- Long-term cough (chronic lung disease)

**Pregnancy and Childbirth:**
- Multiple pregnancies
- Prolonged labor
- Traumatic deliveries
- Large babies
- Instrumental delivery (forceps, vacuum)

**Weakened Pelvic Floor:**
- Previous pelvic surgery
- Aging and tissue weakening
- Hormonal changes (menopause)
- Connective tissue disorders

**Neurological Conditions:**
- Spinal cord injury
- Multiple sclerosis
- Stroke
- Paralysis
- Nerve damage

**Other Medical Conditions:**
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- Cystic fibrosis
- Chronic lung disease
- Parasitic infections (especially in children)

**Anatomical Factors:**
- Elongated colon
- Loose attachments of rectum
- Weak anal sphincter
- Previous rectal surgery

<div class="flash-card" style="background: #fff3e0; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800; margin: 20px 0;">

**⚠️ Important Note**

Having one or more risk factors doesn't mean you will definitely develop rectal prolapse. However, awareness helps you take preventive measures and seek early medical attention if symptoms appear.

</div>

## Recognizing the Symptoms

Early recognition of symptoms is crucial for timely treatment. Rectal prolapse symptoms can range from mild to severe and may develop gradually or suddenly.

### Primary Symptoms

**1. Visible Tissue Protruding from Anus**
- Red, moist tissue extending outside
- May appear during bowel movements initially
- Later may occur with standing, walking, or coughing
- Can retract on its own or require manual reduction
- Size varies from small (few centimeters) to large (10+ cm)

**Appearance:**
- Red or dark pink tissue
- Moist, mucus-covered surface
- Circular or donut-shaped
- May have concentric rings
- Can bleed if irritated

**2. Feeling of Something Coming Out**
- Sensation of bulge or fullness at anus
- Feeling of incomplete evacuation
- Pressure in the pelvic area
- Heaviness or dragging sensation

**3. Mucus Discharge**
- Constant or intermittent mucus leakage

<div class="flash-card" style="background: #e3f2fd; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #2196f3; margin: 20px 0;">

**📊 Symptom Progression**

Rectal prolapse typically progresses through stages:

**Early Stage:** Prolapse only during bowel movements, returns spontaneously

**Middle Stage:** Prolapse with straining, standing, or walking; may need manual reduction

**Advanced Stage:** Prolapse is persistent, difficult to reduce, and may become irreducible

</div>

### Symptoms That Require Immediate Medical Attention

<div class="flash-card" style="background: #fce4ec; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #e91e63; margin: 20px 0;">

**🚨 Emergency Warning Signs**

Seek immediate medical care if you experience:

- **Strangulated prolapse:** Prolapse that cannot be pushed back and becomes dark, purple, or black
- **Severe pain:** Intense, unrelenting pain in the rectal area
- **Heavy bleeding:** Significant blood loss from the rectum
- **Signs of infection:** Fever, severe swelling, foul-smelling discharge
- **Complete inability to pass stool or gas:** May indicate obstruction
- **Tissue death (necrosis):** Blackened, foul-smelling tissue

These symptoms may indicate complications requiring urgent surgical intervention.

</div>

## How Rectal Prolapse Develops

Understanding the progression can help you recognize early signs:

### Stage 1: Weakening of Supports
- Pelvic floor muscles gradually weaken
- Ligaments stretch
- Often no symptoms yet
- Changes may be happening over years

### Stage 2: Internal Changes
- Rectum begins to telescope internally
- May feel incomplete evacuation
- Mild constipation or straining
- Internal intussusception present

### Stage 3: Intermittent Prolapse
- Tissue protrudes during bowel movements
- Returns spontaneously afterward
- Increasing frequency over time
- Beginning of visible symptoms

### Stage 4: Progressive Prolapse
- Prolapse occurs with less provocation
- Standing, coughing, or walking triggers it
- May require manual reduction
- Growing size and duration

### Stage 5: Persistent Prolapse
- Prolapse remains outside most or all the time
- Difficult or impossible to reduce
- Severe symptoms
- High risk of complications

## Distinguishing Rectal Prolapse from Similar Conditions

Several conditions can be confused with rectal prolapse:

### Hemorrhoids (Piles)
**Differences:**
- Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels
- Have grape-like appearance
- Usually painful
- Don't have concentric rings
- Bleed more readily
- Occur in specific positions (internal or external)

**Similarities:**
- Can protrude from anus
- May cause bleeding
- Occur with straining

### Rectal Polyps
**Differences:**
- Usually smaller
- Attached by stalk
- Smooth surface
- Don't have layers
- Often asymptomatic

### Anal Skin Tags
**Differences:**
- Small, soft tissue growths
- Painless
- Don't change size
- Don't retract

<div class="flash-card" style="background: #e8f5e9; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; margin: 20px 0;">

**🔍 Key Distinguishing Feature**

Rectal prolapse shows concentric circular rings or folds (like a "target" or "bulls-eye" pattern), while hemorrhoids appear as distinct masses or grape-like clusters. If you're unsure, always consult a colorectal surgeon for proper diagnosis.

</div>

## When to See a Doctor

### Schedule an Appointment Soon If:

- ✅ You notice any tissue protruding from your anus
- ✅ You have persistent feeling of incomplete evacuation
- ✅ You experience new or worsening fecal incontinence
- ✅ You notice increasing mucus discharge

- ✅ You have chronic constipation requiring excessive straining
- ✅ Your symptoms are affecting your quality of life

### Seek Immediate Care If:

**🚨 Cannot reduce the prolapse**
**🚨 Severe pain in prolapsed tissue**
**🚨 Tissue appears dark, purple, or black**
**🚨 Heavy rectal bleeding**
**🚨 Fever with prolapse**
**🚨 Signs of tissue death**
**🚨 Complete inability to pass stool**

## Why Early Diagnosis Matters

**Prevents Progression:**
- Earlier stages easier to treat
- More treatment options available
- Better outcomes with timely intervention

**Reduces Complications:**
- Prevents tissue damage
- Avoids incarceration or strangulation
- Prevents chronic fecal incontinence

**Improves Quality of Life:**
- Earlier relief of symptoms
- Better functional outcomes
- Reduced psychological impact

**Better Surgical Outcomes:**
- Less complex procedures needed
- Lower recurrence rates
- Faster recovery times

## What to Expect at Your Doctor's Visit

### Medical History
Your doctor will ask about:
- Duration and frequency of symptoms
- What triggers the prolapse
- Bowel movement patterns
- Previous pregnancies and deliveries
- Medical conditions
- Medications
- Impact on daily activities

### Physical Examination
**Visual Inspection:**
- Examination of prolapse at rest
- Assessment during straining
- Evaluation of prolapse size and appearance

**Digital Rectal Examination:**
- Assessment of sphincter tone
- Evaluation of pelvic floor strength
- Checking for masses or abnormalities

**Straining Test:**
- Asked to strain as if having bowel movement
- Helps demonstrate prolapse
- Assesses severity

### Diagnostic Tests (If Needed)
- Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy
- Defecography (special X-ray during defecation)
- Anorectal manometry (measures sphincter pressure)
- Pelvic floor imaging (MRI)
- Transit studies

## Living with Rectal Prolapse: Immediate Management

While awaiting treatment, these measures can help:

### Managing Prolapse Episodes

**Manual Reduction:**
- Wash hands thoroughly
- Use lubricant (petroleum jelly or water-based)
- Gently push tissue back
- Lie down if possible
- Apply gentle, steady pressure
- Don't force if won't go back

**Preventing Episodes:**
- Avoid straining
- Don't delay bowel movements
- Maintain soft stools
- Support pelvic floor when standing
- Avoid heavy lifting

### Symptom Relief

**For Mucus Discharge:**
- Use absorbent pads
- Frequent gentle cleaning
- Barrier creams to protect skin
- Change underwear regularly

**For Skin Irritation:**
- Gentle cleaning with water
- Pat dry, don't rub
- Use barrier creams
- Avoid harsh soaps
- Cotton underwear

**For Constipation:**
- Increase fiber intake
- Drink plenty of water
- Regular meal times
- Gentle exercise
- Stool softeners if needed

<div class="flash-card" style="background: #fff3e0; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800; margin: 20px 0;">

**⚠️ Important Reminder**

These are temporary measures. Manual reduction and symptom management are not treatments for rectal prolapse. Surgical correction is usually needed for permanent solution. Don't delay seeking medical care.

</div>

## Impact on Quality of Life

Rectal prolapse affects more than just physical health:

### Physical Impact
- Pain and discomfort
- Difficulty with daily activities
- Limited mobility

### Social Impact
- Avoiding social situations
- Difficulty with work
- Strained relationships
- Limited travel
- Reduced participation in activities

**Good News:** Treatment can dramatically improve all these aspects of life. Most patients report significant improvement in quality of life after successful treatment.

## Myths and Facts About Rectal Prolapse

### Myth 1: "It's just hemorrhoids"
**Fact:** While they can look similar, rectal prolapse is a different, more serious condition requiring different treatment.

### Myth 2: "It will go away on its own"
**Fact:** Rectal prolapse doesn't resolve without treatment and typically worsens over time.

रेक्टल प्रोल्याप्स एक चिकित्सा अवस्था हो जसको बारेमा धेरै मानिसहरू छलफल गर्न लाज मान्छन्, तर यसले नेपाल र विश्वभरि हजारौं मानिसहरूलाई असर गर्छ। यस अवस्थालाई बुझ्नु उचित उपचार प्राप्त गर्न र तपाईंको जीवनको गुणस्तर सुधार गर्ने पहिलो कदम हो।

## रेक्टल प्रोल्याप्स के हो?

रेक्टल प्रोल्याप्स एक अवस्था हो जसमा मलाशय (ठूलो आन्द्राको अन्तिम भाग) शरीर भित्र आफ्नो सामान्य संलग्नता गुमाउँछ, यसलाई दूरबीन वा गुदा मार्फत बाहिर निस्कन अनुमति दिन्छ। सरल शब्दमा, मलाशयको भित्ता भाग वा सबै आफ्नो ठाउँबाट सर्छ र शरीर बाहिर फैलिन सक्छ।

<div class="flash-card" style="background: #e8f5e9; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #4caf50; margin: 20px 0;">

**💡 शरीर रचना बुझ्नुहोस्**

मलाशय तपाईंको ठूलो आन्द्राको अन्तिम १५-२० से.मी. हो, गुदाको ठीक माथि अवस्थित। सामान्यतया, यो मांसपेशी, लिगामेन्ट, र पेल्भिक फ्लोरको अन्य सहायक तन्तुहरूद्वारा स्थानमा राखिएको हुन्छ। जब यी समर्थनहरू कमजोर हुन्छन्, प्रोल्याप्स हुन सक्छ।

</div>

### रेक्टल प्रोल्याप्सका प्रकारहरू

**१. पूर्ण प्रोल्याप्स (पूर्ण-मोटाई प्रोल्याप्स)**
- मलाशयको सम्पूर्ण भित्ता गुदा मार्फत बाहिर निस्कन्छ
- सबैभन्दा सामान्य प्रकार
- देखिने तन्तु शरीर बाहिर फैलिन्छ
- "बाह्य प्रोल्याप्स" वा "साँचो प्रोल्याप्स" पनि भनिन्छ

**२. आंशिक प्रोल्याप्स (म्युकोसल प्रोल्याप्स)**
- मलाशयको भित्री तह (म्युकोसा) मात्र बाहिर निस्कन्छ
- पूर्ण प्रोल्याप्स भन्दा कम गम्भीर
- दिसा गर्दा हुन सक्छ

**३. आन्तरिक प्रोल्याप्स (आन्तरिक इन्टुससेप्शन)**
- मलाशय भत्किन्छ तर बाहिर निस्कदैन
- बाहिर देखिँदैन
- समान लक्षणहरू निम्त्याउन सक्छ
- उपचार नगरेमा पूर्ण प्रोल्याप्समा प्रगति गर्न सक्छ

## रेक्टल प्रोल्याप्स कसलाई हुन्छ?

### सामान्य जनसांख्यिकी

**५० भन्दा माथिका महिलाहरू:**
- पुरुषहरू भन्दा महिलाहरूमा ६ गुणा बढी सामान्य
- प्रायः बच्चा जन्माउने र कमजोर पेल्भिक फ्लोरसँग सम्बन्धित

**बालबालिका (दुर्लभ):**
- सामान्यतया ४ वर्ष भन्दा अगाडि हुन्छ
- प्रायः रूढिवादी उपचारले समाधान हुन्छ
- वयस्क प्रोल्याप्स भन्दा फरक

### जोखिम कारकहरू

तपाईंको जोखिम के बढाउँछ बुझ्नुले रोकथाम र प्रारम्भिक पत्ता लगाउन मद्दत गर्न सक्छ:

## रेक्टल प्रोल्याप्सलाई समान अवस्थाहरूबाट छुट्याउनु

धेरै अवस्थाहरू रेक्टल प्रोल्याप्ससँग भ्रमित हुन सक्छन्:

### बवासीर (पाइल्स)
**भिन्नताहरू:**
- बवासीर सुन्निएको रक्त नलीहरू हुन्
- अंगूर जस्तो उपस्थिति छ
- सामान्यतया पीडादायक
- संकेन्द्रित रिंगहरू छैनन्
- सजिलै रगत बग्छ
- विशिष्ट स्थितिहरूमा हुन्छ (आन्तरिक वा बाह्य)

### मलाशय पोलिप्स
**भिन्नताहरू:**
- सामान्यतया सानो
- डाँठद्वारा संलग्न
- चिल्लो सतह
- तहहरू छैनन्
- प्रायः लक्षणविहीन

### गुदा छाला ट्यागहरू
**भिन्नताहरू:**
- साना, नरम तन्तु वृद्धि
- पीडारहित
- आकार परिवर्तन गर्दैन
- पछि हट्दैन

**🔍 मुख्य विशिष्ट विशेषता**

रेक्टल प्रोल्याप्सले संकेन्द्रित गोलाकार रिंगहरू वा तहहरू देखाउँछ ("लक्ष्य" वा "बुल्स-आई" ढाँचा जस्तै), जबकि बवासीर विशिष्ट मास वा अंगूर जस्तो समूहहरू जस्तो देखिन्छ। यदि तपाईं निश्चित हुनुहुन्न भने, उचित निदानको लागि सधैं कोलोरेक्टल सर्जनसँग परामर्श लिनुहोस्।
